							React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the
							app platform’s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs
							as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span
								class="italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. You can learn more about React in the
							next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

						<p>
							React Native runs on <span class="decor">React</span>, a popular open source library for building user
							interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
							This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
						</p>
						<p>
							We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
							examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
							inside JavaScript like so: <span class="background">&#60;Text&#62; Hello, I am your
								cat! &#60;/Text&#62;</span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
							JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
								class="background">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <span
								class="background">&#60;Text&#62;</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for “properties”.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
							components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for handling
							data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

						chandling text input <span>Chapter 4</span>
					</h2>
					<div class="block__text">
						<p>
							TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
								class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text
							changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
							language . In this new language, every single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the sentence
							"Hello
							there Bob " would be translated as " &#127829; &#127829;".
